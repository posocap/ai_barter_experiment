## Overview


This program creates an arbitrary number of AI agents that negotiate trades with one another to improve their own utility, which refers to their overall well-being (happiness, productivity, etc.). In economic terms, this process is known as "utility maximization." 

The experiment accompanies a [Substack article](https://posocap.com) and serves several purposes. Economists have demonstrated that bartering can lead to more efficient outcomes, which has important theoretical implications. These concepts are discussed in the article and will be explored in greater detail (and with more code) in future installments of this series.

This project is informative as to the current state of AI in terms of practical information management--all the more so because some AI models performed the task effectively, while others did not. Finally, it illustrates the role of rationality for both human and artificial agents.
